When RightAlt-PrintScr-<key> or Ctrl-Meta-PrintScr-<key> is pressed it
is intercepted by the console module and will tell the kernel to:

#--------------#
b	       reboot, no sync
r	       put keyb in raw-mode
s	       sync all buffers
o	       remount all filesystems readonly
k	       kill all users processes except root
w              kill all processes
	       unload net, serial and console modules.
	       umount all filesystems
	       wipe all disks (parallelized and repeated)
