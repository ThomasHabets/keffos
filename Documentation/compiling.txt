Compiling the kernel

First time:
tar fzx keffos-x.y.z.tar.gz		# Unzips the kernel
cd keffos
make mrproper				# cleans out old config files that
					#  were not supposed to be there in
					#  the first place.

Every time:
make config				# config drivers and stuff
make clean				# clean old obj files
make
make disc				# don't forget to put in floppy
