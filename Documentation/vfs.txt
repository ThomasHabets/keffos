VFS System:

Files (file_t) are just pointers to inodes (inode_t).

open():
vfs:
 * Check which mounted device the file is on
 * strip path to that mountpoint (/home/foo -> foo)
 * find fs driver for device
fs driver:
 * get inode for file
 * check permission to open is requested mode
 * mark dentry (see below) as in-use
vfs:
 * create file structure (open_file_t)
 * increment mounted device usage count

close():
vfs:
 * find dentry
fs:
 * sync (not below blockdevice-level)
vfs:
 * mark dentry as not in-use
 * mark dentry last used

Since getting the inode can take a while (even with block-level cache) a
dentry (dentry_t) is used to cache file -> inode translations. This also
avoids the first three steps in the vfs layer (device & fs driver).
