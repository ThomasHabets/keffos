Two separate debuggers (as modules):

#------------------------------------#
debug:
    When a program crashes, a user-configurable program is
    run for debugging.

#------------------------------------#
kdebug:
    if kernel panics, kdebug is run and enters kernel debugging
    mode.
    
    The debugger can be big because the kernel doesn't have to
    have it loaded all the time and there is no loss if it is
    buggy because let's face it, the kernel just crashed.

    This should only be used to retrieve important data
    that is in memory at the time of the crash.

See kernel/kernel/kdebug.c for commands.
